# Bank-Data-Analysis Problem
In spite of non-interest incomes on the rise, over half the money made by banks still comes from net interest earnings. A bankâ€™s success heavily relies upon how many loans it can give out while maintaining low default rates, where default means the inability of the borrowers to pay back the loan in time. Provide Mammoth Bank with a strategy to predict customers who default or not.
**#	Purpose**
Build the model which will predict the bank customers who are default or not i.e., to predict the inability of the borrowers to pay back the loan in time.
In this report, initial exploratory data analysis has been performed and then data was partitioned in training and testing data. Found the coefficient for the variables. Train or fit the LASSO Logistic Regression Model, get prediction using testing set data. Finally, evaluate model performance by finding area under the curve.
